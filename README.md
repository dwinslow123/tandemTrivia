# Tandem Trivia
Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my interpretation of the Tandem Trivia App. I built mine using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

If you'd like to view the app live you can find it [here](https://glacial-eyrie-03267.herokuapp.com/).

And if you'd like to view to code it can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/dwinslow123/tandemTrivia).

## Additional Features
These are future adjustments I'd like to make to the app.

* Add testing - This is something I would love to discuss with someone experienced in the process.
* Add more animations / make the app "prettier".
